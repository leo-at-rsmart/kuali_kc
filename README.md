Kuali Coeus
===========

FYI - this is a *complete* copy of the entire KC history [1] into git. This repository is quite large (~3.6GB), so if you only want to work with more recent history (and want to save some local disk space), then perform your clone like:

```git clone --depth 200 git://github.com/rSmart/kuali_kc.git```
